# Web Push CodeIgniter

This is sample application for demonstrating sending web push notification with PHP and CodeIgniter framework. I use package [web-push-php](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php) for sending web push so please fulfill the requirement for implementing the package. You may have to install that package using composer.

I only use one controller (Push.php) and one view file to simplify the sample. I also write main.js for sending ajax request.
